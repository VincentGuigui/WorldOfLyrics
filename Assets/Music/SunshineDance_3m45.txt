I’m walking down this quiet lane
Shoes tapping in the soft refrain
The trees are humming
They call my name
Whispering secrets in their playful game

Sunshine pouring
Golden beams
Life feels lighter
Bursting seams
Rainbow’s arching
Colors gleam
Dancing outside
Chasing dreams

The forest greets me
Arms out wide
Leaves are rustling
Can't hide their pride
A symphony of nature’s stride
Guides my feet
I let it decide

Sunshine pouring
Golden beams
Life feels lighter
Bursting seams
Rainbow’s arching
Colors gleam
Dancing outside
Chasing dreams

Feet bare on grass
It’s cool
It’s right
Sky turns from blue to soft twilight
Twisting
Turning
Stars ignite
This is freedom
Love takes flight

Sunshine pouring
Golden beams
Life feels lighter
Bursting seams
Rainbow’s arching
Colors gleam
Dancing outside
Chasing dreams
